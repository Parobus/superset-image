A modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application.

## Overview

This Docker image is an extended image from the official [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset) with additional requirements such as snowflake-sqlalchemy, gunicron and gevent

## Running the docker stack local

- For running the stack for the first time we are going to use the docker-compose-init.yml file as it has the init_service container to create the required initial user and setting up the database `superset db update`
  - `make build_init`
  - `make up_init` In this stack the superset-app is using the Flask development web server which is not intended to be used in production
- To run the stack without the init_service, no need to re-initialize
  - `make build`
  - `make up` In this stack the superset-app is using the gunicorn web server with gevent worker-class `production use`

## Environment file

All the containers in docker-compose stack using the docker-compose.local.env file, you can customize the environments variables
